What is react?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to 
create reusable UI components and manage 
state changes in your application. React is a one-way data binding library,
meaning that it only updates the UI when the state changes, and not the other way around.

Babel:
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to write modern JavaScript code
and compile it to older versions of JavaScript that can be run in older browsers.
