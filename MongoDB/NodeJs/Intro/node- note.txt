node js - it is a runtime environment for js that is used to execute js outside the browser.
core concepts in node js- 
1. single threaded model- a single thread processes multiple client request via event loop.
2. non blocking i/o operation- node js does not wait for an operation to be completed.
example- reading a file.
such operations are handled asynchronously .

event driven architecture- node js operates an event loop to handle asynchronous operations like file read/write, or http request etc. 

modules in node js- 
modules are reusable blocks of code. types of modules are 
core mudules(inbuilt modules)- ex- http, fs etc.

userdefine module- these are programmer define .

third part modules- they are installed via npm. 

File system module in node js- the fs module gives functionality to interact with files. 
we can perform operations like reading, writing etc.

writing into a file- fs.write File Sync()- Synchronous
this functions are used to write new data into a file.every time the function is executed it overrides the previous data. 


appending into a file- fs.append File Sync.()- synchronous- these files are used to insert new data into the files without overriding the previous data. 




fs.writeFile(filename, data, callback)-> asynchronous
